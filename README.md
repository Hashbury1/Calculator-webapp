# A Simple Calculator Web application


This is a clean, responsive web-based calculator designed for performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). It is implemented using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and focuses on fast, reliable, and accessible calculations.

✨ Features
Standard Operations: Supports +, -, *, and /.

Decimal Support: Handles non-integer calculations.

Clear Functionality: Dedicated "Clear" (C) and "Clear Entry" (CE) buttons.

Responsive Design: Optimized for use on both desktop browsers and mobile devices.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5: Structure

CSS3: Styling and layout (including Flexbox/Grid for responsiveness)

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): Core calculation logic and DOM manipulation
